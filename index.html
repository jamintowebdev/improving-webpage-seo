    <p class="para1">This is some content.</p>
    <h3>Meta description</h3>
    <p class="para2">The next meta tag is the <b>description</b>. <br>
        It acts like a synopsis on the back of a book. The title is the heading, and the <br> meta description is an
        extra couple sentences of information that further <br> describe what the content is about.<br>The description
        is created using a &lt;meta&gt; tag:</p>
    <p class="para3"> &lt;meta name="description" content="Join Now to learn the basics or advance your existing
        skills."&gt; </p>

    <h3>Headings</h3>
    <p class="para4">We have already seen headings in the previous modules. <br>
        They are created using the tags <b>&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;</b> and help organize your content. <br><br>

        In addition to organizing the content, headings also help with your <strong>SEO</strong>. <br>
        Search engines use them to determine segments of content on your page.</p>
    <p class="para5">Here is the hierarchy of heading tags: <br>
        <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b> - usually reserved for web page titles. <br>
        <b>&lt;h2&gt;</b> - highlights the topic of the title. <br>
        <b>&lt;h3&gt;</b> - reflects points in regards to the topic. <br>
        <b>&lt;h4&gt;</b> - supports points from
        <b>&lt;h3&gt;</b> . <br>
        <b>&lt;h5&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;h6&gt;</b> - not often used, but can be used to further breakdown points of
        <b>&lt;h4&gt;</b> .
    </p> <br>

    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p class="para6">Images play an important role in your web pages. <br> <br>
        According to statistics, articles that include images get about 94% more views than articles without them.
        Images are created using the <b>&lt;img&gt;</b> tag and use the src attribute to refer to the image file.</p>
    <p class="para7">However, search engines are not able to determine what your images show.
        That is why the <b>&lt;alt&gt;</b> attribute is important. It stand for <b>alternative text</b> and describes
        what the image is about:</p>
