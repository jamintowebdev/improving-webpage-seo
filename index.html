    <h1>Improving Webpage SEO in index.html file.</h1>
    <p class="para1">This is some content.</p>
    <h3>Meta description</h3>
    <p class="para2">The next meta tag is the <b>description</b>. <br>
        It acts like a synopsis on the back of a book. The title is the heading, and the <br> meta description is an
        extra couple sentences of information that further <br> describe what the content is about.<br>The description
        is created using a &lt;meta&gt; tag:</p>
    <p class="para-codebox"> <b>&lt;meta name="description" content="Join Now to learn the basics or advance your
            existing
            skills."&gt;</b> </p>

    <h3>Headings</h3>
    <p class="para4">We have already seen headings in the previous modules. <br>
        They are created using the tags <b>&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;</b> and help organize your content. <br><br>

        In addition to organizing the content, headings also help with your <strong>SEO</strong>. <br>
        Search engines use them to determine segments of content on your page.</p>
    <p class="para5">Here is the hierarchy of heading tags: <br>
        <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b> - usually reserved for web page titles. <br>
        <b>&lt;h2&gt;</b> - highlights the topic of the title. <br>
        <b>&lt;h3&gt;</b> - reflects points in regards to the topic. <br>
        <b>&lt;h4&gt;</b> - supports points from
        <b>&lt;h3&gt;</b> . <br>
        <b>&lt;h5&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;h6&gt;</b> - not often used, but can be used to further breakdown points of
        <b>&lt;h4&gt;</b> .
    </p> <br>

    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p class="para6">Images play an important role in your web pages. <br> <br>
        According to statistics, articles that include images get about 94% more views than articles without them.
        Images are created using the <b>&lt;img&gt;</b> tag and use the <b>&lt;src&gt;</b> attribute to refer to the
        image file.</p>
    <p class="para7">However, search engines are not able to determine what your images show.
        That is why the <b>&lt;alt&gt;</b> attribute is important. It stand for <b>alternative text</b> and describes
        what the image is about:</p>

    <div class="links">
        <h1>Links</h1>
        <p class="para8">
            <b>Links</b> play a vital part in SEO. They determine the ranking of your website on <br> search engines and
            act
            as a "vote" to your page. <br>
            Having many <b>quality</b> links to your page increases the page ranking. <br> <br>

            The same applies to outbound links. <br>
            Linking out to something that isn't relevant to your topic can result in search <br> penalties. <br><br>

            If you need to link to a page but don't want search engines to consider that <br> connection, you can use
            <b>"nofollow"</b> links. <br>
            By doing this, you are preventing the external domain to which you are linking <br> from benefiting from
            additional domain authority. <br><br>

            Here is how to create a <b>"nofollow"</b> link:
            <br><br>
        <p class="para-codebox"><b>&lt;a href="https://somesite.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;</b></p>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="graph">
        <h1>Open Graph Tags</h1>
        <p class="para_graph">There are special tags that are used by social media. <br>
            These tags specify how your page should look when shared on social <br> networks such as Facebook. <br><br>

            Facebook, for instance, uses <b>Open Graph tags</b> to display information when <br> your content is shared.
            <br><br>

            Open Graph tags are meta tags that go into the &lt;head&gt; of your page. The most <br> popular ones are
            <b>title, description</b> and <b>image</b>. <br><br>

            Here's an example of a open graph tags: <br>
        <p class="para-codebox">&lt;meta property="og:title" content="SoloLearn: Learn to Code"&gt; <br> <br>

            &lt;meta property="og:description" content="Join Now to learn the basics or advance your existing
            skills"&gt; <br><br>

            &lt;meta property="og:image" content="logo.png"&gt; </p> <br>

        <p>Note, that the tags use the prefix og: before their names.<br> <br>

            Here is the page when shared on Facebook:</p>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamintowebdev/improving-webpage-seo/main/solo-graph-htmlseo.png"
            alt="this is a screenshot image of graph related and og prefix for seo and html modification">
        </p>
        <p>You can have one meta description and title for search engines and another <br> for Facebook. <br>
            The Open Graph tags give you customization options if your webpage is <br> shared on social media.</p>
        <p class="note-bg-color">Similar meta tags exist for Twitter and other social networks. <br>
            We will not cover all of them, as it is more important to know how <br> to use them when necessary, than
            memorizing the names. You can <br> easily find the appropriate meta tag online when needed.</p>
