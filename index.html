    <p>This is some content.</p>
    <h3>Meta description</h3>
    <p>The next meta tag is the <b>description</b>. <br>
        It acts like a synopsis on the back of a book. The title is the heading, and the <br> meta description is an
        extra couple sentences of information that further <br> describe what the content is about.<br>The description
        is created using a &lt;meta&gt; tag:</p>
    <p class="para3"> &lt;meta name="description" content="Join Now to learn the basics or advance your existing
        skills."&gt; </p>

    <h3>Headings</h3>
    <p>We have already seen headings in the previous modules. <br>
        They are created using the tags <b>&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;</b> and help organize your content. <br><br>

        In addition to organizing the content, headings also help with your <strong>SEO</strong>. <br>
        Search engines use them to determine segments of content on your page.</p>
